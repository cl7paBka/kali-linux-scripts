## Using the `install_nekobox.sh` Script  

The `install_nekobox.sh` script automates the installation of NekoBox on Kali Linux. Follow these steps:  

### 1. Make the Script Executable  
Before running the script, ensure it has execute permissions:  
1. Open a terminal.  
2. Navigate to the repository folder (if not already there):  
   ```bash  
   cd kali-linux-scripts  
   ```
3. Run:
   ```
   chmod +x install_nekobox.sh
   ```
   
### 2. Run the Script  
Execute the script with `sudo` to install NekoBox:  
   ```bash  
   sudo -E ./install_nekobox.sh  
   ```

#### Why -E?
The -E flag preserves the current user's environment variables (like $HOME) when using sudo. This ensures the script uses your regular user's home directory (/home/your-username) instead of the root user's (/root).
